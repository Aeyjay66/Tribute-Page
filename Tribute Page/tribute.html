        <br>
        Muhammad was born approximately 570 CE in Mecca.He was the son of "Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib" and "Amina bint Wahb". His father Abdullah was the son of Quraysh tribal leader Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, and he died a few months before Muhammad's birth. His mother Amina died when he was six, leaving Muhammad an orphan. He was raised under the care of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, and paternal uncle, Abu Talib.In later years, he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer.When he was 40, Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave and receiving his first revelation from God. <strong>In 613, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly,proclaiming that "God is One", and that the complete "submission" (islām) to God is the right way of life (dīn), and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam.</strong></p>
